# rmf_schedule_visualizer

Greetings,

We have migrated the development of the Robotics Middleware Framework (RMF) to a dedicated organization, [open-rmf](https://github.com/open-rmf).

The packages here have been split up into
* [rmf_visualization](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_visualization)
* [rmf_visualization_msgs](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_visualization_msgs)

More instructions on setting up RMF and running demonstrations can be found [here](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf).
